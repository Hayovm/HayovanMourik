# 🌱 Lysimeter Weight Logging System

This system uses Arduino to measure and log the weight from two different load cell configurations — one using four load cells, and another using a single load cell. Data is saved to an SD card with a real-time timestamp for each reading. Ideal for monitoring organic matter in environmental experiments.

---

## 📦 System Overview

- **Load Cell Group 1:** Four load cells → HX711 → Arduino
- **Load Cell Group 2:** One load cell → HX711 → Arduino
- Both groups provide separate outputs and are saved with timestamps.
- Data is written to an SD card in CSV format.

## 🖥️ Serial Monitor Commands

> ⚠️ Note: Due to a serial input quirk, you may need to send commands **quickly and multiple times** in the Serial Monitor for them to register.

### 🔧 Calibration

Use the following commands to calibrate the load cells:

- Type `1` → calibrates **Group 1** (four load cells)
- Type `2` → calibrates **Group 2** (single load cell)

You'll be guided through a **tare process** and asked to place a known heavy weight (2–3 kg recommended).

> 🧪 Typical calibration factors: `292–293`  
> 📉 Lighter or heavier calibration weights may affect accuracy. You may experiment with different loads.

### ⚖️ Taring

### 🕒 Set Timestamp Manually

If the real-time clock (RTC) battery is dead or missing, manually set the time with: set 


> By default, the RTC time syncs with your computer clock when uploading the code.

### ⏲️ Change Measurement Interval

To change how frequently the system records data:

- Open the Arduino sketch.
- Go to **line 32**.
- Change the value to your desired interval (in milliseconds).

## ⚙️ Power-On Procedure

The system automatically **tares** when powered on and starts running the last uploaded sketch.

To avoid incorrect readings, follow this order:

1. **Close** the grey tray to protect the electronics.
2. **Place** the grey tray on the load cells.
3. **Power on** the device.
4. **Add** dry organic matter to the litter tray.

## 🪵 Tray Placement Guide

Ensure the tray is correctly aligned:

- Match the **“F – F”** marks (black "f") on both the **wooden frame** and **tray**.
- The tray should rest **easily** on the **black screw spots** — don’t use force.

## 💧 Filter Maintenance

The system's filter may **clog** after heavy rainfall over several days.

> 💡 Regular inspection and improvement of the filter design is recommended for long-term use.

---

## 📁 Data Output

- Output format: `.CSV`
- Each row contains: 
  - Timestamp
  - Weight from Group 1 (4 load cells)
  - Weight from Group 2 (1 load cell)

---

## 🔌 Required Hardware

- Arduino Uno / Nano
- 2 × HX711 Load Cell Amplifiers
- 5 × Load Cells (4 for base, 1 for litter tray)
- SD Card Module
- RTC Module (e.g., DS3231)
- Power Supply
- Protective Grey Tray
- Wooden Mount Frame
